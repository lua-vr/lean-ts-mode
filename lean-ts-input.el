;;;; A highly customisable input method which can inherit from other
;; Quail input methods.  By default the input method is geared towards
;; the input of mathematical and other symbols in Lean programs.
;;
;; Use M-x customize-group lean-ts-input to customize this input method.
;; Note that the functions defined under "Functions used to tweak
;; translation pairs" below can be used to tweak both the key
;; translations inherited from other input methods as well as the
;; ones added specifically for this one.
;;
;; Use lean-ts-input-show-translations to see all the characters which
;; can be typed using this input method (except for those
;; corresponding to ASCII characters).

;;; Code:

(require 'quail)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'subr-x)
(require 'map)
(require 'lean-ts-data)

;; Quail is quite stateful, so be careful when editing this code.  Note
;; that with-temp-buffer is used below whenever buffer-local state is
;; modified.

;; 'custom-initialize-default to ensure that the setup is not performed
;; until lean-ts-input-setup is called at the end of this file.
